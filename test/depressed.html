  <h1>Depressed</h1>
  <p>A thick, grey fog of hopelessness had settled over his mind for weeks, leeching all the color and meaning out of
    his
    daily routine. He was profoundly depressed, experiencing an all-encompassing fatigue that made even the simplest
    tasks
    feel monumental and pointless. The once-loved hobbies lay untouched, a symbol of the profound anhedonia—the
    sustained
    loss of pleasure—that had taken root. He felt a deep sense of worthlessness, a quiet, gnawing pain that made him
    want to
    withdraw completely from the world.</p>
