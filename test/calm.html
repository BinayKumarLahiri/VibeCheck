  <h1>Calm</h1>
  <p>She sat by the window, watching the rain fall, her mind clear and peacefully tranquil. There was a quiet composure
    in
    her posture, a complete lack of agitation despite the swirling chaos of the week's problems. She felt deeply calm,
    her
    breathing even and slow, her thoughts moving with a measured, deliberate clarity. This serene state wasn't achieved
    by
    avoiding her thoughts, but by accepting them without reaction, finding a solid, unshakable core of emotional
    stability
    within herself.</p>
